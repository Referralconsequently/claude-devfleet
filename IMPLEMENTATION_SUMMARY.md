## Technology Stack

### Claude Models Used
| Feature | Model | Capabilities |
|---------|-------|---|
| Intelligent Planner | glm-5.1 | Extended thinking, structured outputs |
| Project Analyzer | glm-5.1 | Vision, reasoning |
| Others | N/A | Local analysis only |

### Dependencies (Already in requirements.txt)
- FastAPI — API framework
- aiosqlite — Database access
- Pydantic — Data validation
- claude-code-sdk — Claude integration

### New Python Modules
- No external dependencies added
- Uses standard library + existing project dependencies

---

## Integration Points

### Database
- Reads from: `missions`, `agent_sessions`, `reports`, `projects`, `mission_events`
- No new tables required
- Fully backward compatible

### Mission Execution
- Intelligent Planner creates missions with `auto_dispatch=true`
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Mission Watcher
- Agents execute in optimal dependency order
- Reports flow naturally to Health Dashboard & Cost Optimizer

### Session Tracking
- Uses existing `agent_sessions` cost tracking
- Works with SDK engine and CLI dispatcher
- Enables cost analysis for all execution modes

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Extended Thinking for Planning
- **Why**: Project planning benefits from deep reasoning about complexity and dependencies
- **How**: Budget up to 8000 thinking tokens (reasonable for planning, not runtime)
- **Cost**: Minimal overhead since planning is one-time activity

### 2. Vision for Analysis
- **Why**: Developers often have architecture diagrams, screenshots, docs
- **How**: Supports image files (PNG, JPG, WebP) + text
- **Fallback**: Heuristic analysis if vision unavailable

### 3. Local Analysis for Metrics
- **Why**: Cost, health, and visualization don't need AI reasoning
- **How**: Pure algorithmic analysis of DB data
- **Benefit**: Fast (no LLM calls), reliable, fully deterministic

### 4. Structured Outputs
- **Why**: Enables downstream processing and dashboard integration
- **How**: JSON schemas for all responses
- **Benefit**: Type-safe, easily integrates with frontend

### 5. Mermaid Diagrams
- **Why**: Native markdown support, renders in GitHub, VS Code, etc.
- **How**: Pure algorithmic generation from mission data
- **Benefit**: No external visualization service needed
